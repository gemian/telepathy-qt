      <p>This interface allows many attributes of many rooms to be

          <p>Connection managers SHOULD ignore interfaces requested which they

          <tp:rationale>
            <p>This simplifies client-side code. Clients which care may
              distinguish between unsupported interfaces (e.g. this Connection
              does not support RoomConfig), and interfaces on which no information
              is known for these rooms (e.g. we don't know the avatar tokens
              of any of the rooms, so we omitted them all) by inspecting

          <p>As well as returning cached information immediately, the
            connection MAY start asynchronous requests to obtain better
            values for the room attributes. If better values are later
            obtained by this process, they will be indicated with the usual
